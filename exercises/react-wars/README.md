PERSONAL REACT READUX APP - MONSTER FACTORY BOY COUNTER EXPERIENCE
=================================

The prompt was to create a personal react redux website, utilizing an API request to an external site.

I created a site that pulls data from the Web Series "Monster Factory" using the Youtube API. The app renders a full list, as well as giving a random button that pushes to a random video.

To Add:
 - needs to fix the get requests so they pull the whole youtube playlist - currently they are limited to 50.
