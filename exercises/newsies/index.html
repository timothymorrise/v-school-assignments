        <p> Ryuuji Akiyama stars in show about committee judging people's stories of almost having sex Abema TV announced on
            Friday that it has green-lit a live-action series adaptation of Takashi Yoshida's <span class="italics">Yareta kamo Iinkai (The Almost
            Got Laid Committee)</span> manga. The series will debut on the AbemaTV streaming platform in January, and Ryuuji Akiyama
            (seen below) will play the character Akira N≈çjima.</p>
        <p>The manga's story centers on the titular "committee," comprised of a martial artist, a musician, and an executive,
            who listen to the stories of clients who come in to hear their judgement. Clients come in and tell their stories
            about their romantic lives, focusing on points where they think they might have had sex, but ended up not doing
            it. The committee then delivers their judgement on whether or not they think the client might have actually ended
            up having sex at that point if something had been different.</p>
        <p>Yoshida launched the manga in April 2016 on the note website, and he also publishes the series in Shuho Sato's Manga
            on Web web magazine, and on the websites cake and PixivFANBOX. Yoshida asks readers to send in their own stories,
            which he then portrays in the manga.</p>

        <p>Futabasha published the manga's first compiled volume on June 28.
