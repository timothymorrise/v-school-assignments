Bugs On A Plane
====================

A debugging assignment, a travel form using a responsive HTML file that takes an input and returns the data in an alert. (From this repository https://github.com/VSchool/bugs-on-a-plane).
It was tricky catching these semantic errors and also adjusting the diet object to an array. Also added some Template Literals to the array push to help with readability in the alert.
