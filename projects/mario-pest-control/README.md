Mario Pest Control
====================

This project had us design a website that updated a Tally of an amount "owed" to Mario based on how many enemies he killed. The most tricky part was the responsive design. If I could go back I'd probably reorganize somethings in flexbox. Beyond that there was a lot of learning in making sure that the background image rendered well and was responsive.
